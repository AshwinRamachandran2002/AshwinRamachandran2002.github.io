Hi there! I am Ashwin Ramachandran. I am a senior undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay in the [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/) department. Almost everything in computer science, with a specific liking for NLP and LLMs.

I am currently working on my *Bacheor's thesis* on efficient graph retrival techniques advised by [Prof. Soumen Chakrabarti](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~soumen/) and [Prof. Abir De](https://abir-de.github.io/). I am also involved with [Prof. Peter Stone](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/)'s research group at [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), working on adverserial model learning paradigms.

During the summer of 2022, I interned at [Google](https://optiver.com/) in Bangalore as a software engineering intern. I have also worked  with [Prof. Thomas Deserno](https://www.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/users/fekete/)'s group at [Technische Universit√§t Braunschweig](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/).

As a hobby, I love working on web development projects and was a Project Lead at [DevCom](https://in.linkedin.com/company/devcom-iit-bombay), the Developer's Community of IIT Bombay,  last year.

Always on the lookout for new opportunities in CS!
