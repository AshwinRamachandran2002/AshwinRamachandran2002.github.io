# Problem
How far is the most efficient embedding obtained using optimization and the emebddings created by the transformer during training?
Are both the same?

## Task
- Get 3 sentences on Trump, that are facts around him
- Now optimize for the embedding of Trump that best gives the 3 sentences in consideration
- Compare the emebedding so obtained with actual Trump embedding

## Experiment
- Trump was chosen because it was a single token
