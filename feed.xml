In this scenario, we’ll explore a toy dataset in JSON Key-Value format. The model is exposed to all existing (Key, Value) pairs and is ultimately prompted to print the corresponding value for a given key. The challenge here is to ensure that the model considers all (Key, Value) pairs at the same relative positions.</p> <h1 id="experiment-1">Experiment 1</h1> <h2 id="preliminaries">Preliminaries</h2> <p>The Unlimiformer paper presents a faster extension of the Memorizing Transformer paper. Unlike the latter, Unlimiformer maintains a single index instead of an index per head per layer. However, the model we’re examining is an encoder-decoder model where all key vectors are derived from the output of the last encoder layer. Therefore, the attention score (x_q^T W_q^T W_k x_e) is divided into an index (x_e) and a query to the vector store (x_q^T W_q^T W_k). This ensures that the index-to-query relationship remains consistent across different heads and attentions. Note that x_e represents the output hidden state of the last encoder layer, which is used to compute key vectors in an encoder-decoder model.</p> <h2 id="unlimiformer-for-decoder-only-models">Unlimiformer for Decoder-Only Models</h2> <p>When dealing with decoder-only models, we encounter two challenges:</p> <h3 id="1-different-inputs-for-key-and-value-computation">1. Different Inputs for Key and Value Computation</h3> <p>In decoder-only models, the input to compute keys and values comes from the output of the previous decoder layer, which varies for each layer. This necessitates having as many indexes as there are decoder layers.</p> <h3 id="2-rope-embeddings-and-efficient-indexing">2. RoPE Embeddings and Efficient Indexing</h3> <p>Recent open-source models utilize RoPE (Relative Position Embeddings), which provide relative positional information between key and query vectors. The attention score calculation now includes RoPE embeddings: (x_q^T W_q^T R(s) W_k x_k), where R(s) is a rotation matrix dependent on the relative distance (s) between the query and key tokens. To create an efficient index akin to Unlimiformer, we need to restrict the number of indexes to the number of decoder layers. In the attention score calculation, R(s) and x_k are parameters dependent on the key vector, making it desirable to store them in the index, while the rest of the computation pertains to vectorstore queries.</p> <h2 id="examination-of-unlimiformers-implementation-for-decoder-only-models">Examination of Unlimiformer’s Implementation for Decoder-Only Models</h2> <p>The Unlimiformer implementation makes two approximations, which are confirmed experimentally:</p> <h3 id="1-constructing-the-vectorstore-query">1. Constructing the Vectorstore Query</h3> <p>The query is calculated as follows: (R(m) * W_q * x_q)^T (W_k + Rotated(W_k)). Rotated(W_k) is a method for efficiently applying rotation to a vector, avoiding the need for matrix-matrix multiplication. The implementation approximates (cos = sin) since cos and sin are represented as vectors rather than trigonometric functions, as described in the code.</p> <h3 id="2-applying-final-relative-position-indices">2. Applying Final Relative Position Indices</h3> <p>After retrieving the top-k closest hidden states and projecting them using W_k, Unlimiformer performs rotation uniformly, assuming that the starting retrieved key serves as the origin. However, an issue arises where the query is also assigned a relative position with the origin at the first generated token. This may affect the query token’s performance, favoring the middle retrieved key over those on either side.</p> <h2 id="high-complexity-retrieval-methodology">High-Complexity Retrieval Methodology</h2> <p>To address these challenges, a complex series of steps is employed to convert the attention score into cosine similarity between a vector dependent on x_k and one independent of x_k. Additionally, the embedding dimension in the vector store is quadratically increased from the transformer’s embedding dimension to (attention-dim * embedding-dim).</p> <h3 id="query-and-key-values">Query and Key Values</h3> <ul> <li>Query to vectorstore: Concatenate [x .

This is a problem that is being addressed by the research community. The aim of this project is to reduce hallucinations in LLMs. Today, applications use an LLM alongside a database</p> <h1 id="quivr">Quivr</h1> <h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2> <p>The Quivr application is a web app that was introduced as a second brain. It allows users to upload pdfs, images, etc or websites and then query the “second brain” at a later time. Users need not go through all the information again but the application answers the queries using an LLM. The application uses Langchain Document Query api to retrieve the correct source and correct chunk and supplies it to the LLM as context. The context along with the query is input to the LLM and the LLM answers appropriately.</p> <h2 id="problems-with-the-application">Problems with the application</h2> <p>I tried uploading a bunch of pdfs and asked a bunch of questions. The LLM would incorrectly use it’s hallucinations to answer the question. The hallucinations were not even close to the answer. This would imply that the context supplied to the LLM is not relevant to the query being asked. A better way to supply context is required.</p> <h1 id="colbert-model-from-stanford">COLBERT model from Stanford</h1> <p>Developed by the Stanford NLP group, Omar Khatab.</p> <h2 id="how-it-works-1">How it works</h2> <p>I noticed the COLBERT2 retriever which used late interaction to retrieve relevant context from a huge corpus given a query. The model does not convert the whole paragraph to an embedding, i.e. it does not use the final fully connected layer in transformers to obtain a single embedding, but leaves the output as a bunch of embeddings as is produced from a decoder of a transformer. All the chunks in the corpus are converted to such group of embeddings and kept aside to be used during runtime. The query when input, is processed and output as a bunch of embeddings. These embeddings are now compared against each other on a token level rather than on a sentence level, and the result noticed is greatly better than than a sentence level comparison.</p> <h2 id="applications">Applications</h2> <p>The COLBERT model was demonstrated on the wikipedia corpus. Given a sentence “When was Titanic released?” and “Titanic, a classic, was out in theatres by 2nd October.”, the model gave a high similarity score for the tokens, “released” and “out in”, “titanic” with “titanic”, “When” with “2nd October”.</p> <h1 id="the-dsp-model">The DSP model</h1> <p>Developed by the Stanford NLP group, Omar Khatab.</p> <h2 id="how-it-works-2">How it works</h2> <p>The Demonstrate Search Predict framework, combines both the COLBERT model and the LLM. The DSP model is a multihop process. The LLM tries to break the question into multiple questions. It tries to determine the information required to answer the question. The information to be acquired is posed as a question to the COLBERT2 model which fetches the relevant context. It returns the most relevant k chunks. These chunks are given to the LLM as context, the model then uses the context to either answer the question or decide to ask more questions to make a better decision.</p> <h2 id="ncert-question-answer-retriever">NCERT Question-Answer Retriever</h2> <p>The DSP framework requires a manual setting of the number of hops it has to take before arriving at an answer. I tested out the system on the NCERT Chemistry 12th standard TextBooks and asked it the questions posed to students as part of their CBSE board examination and received the correct in answer in 80 percent of the cases. Few of the questions, it failed to answer correctly since the PDF couldn’t be converted to a text format as it was a scanned copy. The equations were converted in a jumbled manner and the sections were not formatte properly. The PDFConverter used was the Langchain API. Another factor was the size of the chunk to divide the text into; I estimate the accuracy would have been better if specific sections and paragraphs were converted as one chunk instead of division on the basis of number of tokens in a chunk. I write a more detailed blog on the NCERT Question-Answer Retriever in another blog post.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction LLMs suffer from hallucinations.

This is a major privacy concern as the user may input sensitive information to the model. The company may use the information to train the model further or other purposes. A way to introduce prompts in a more privacy preserving manner is required.</p> <h2 id="privategpt">PrivateGPT</h2> <p>A agent introduced to tackle the issue of PII present in the prompts input by users. But the agent uses a heurisitic method where it identifies PII of 50+ categories and removes it from the prompt. This is not a scalable solution as the number of categories can be infinite.</p> <h2 id="encrypted-input">Encrypted Input</h2> <p>The best solution would be to have the input encrypted using a Secret Key known only to the user and have the model use it’s present trained weights in some way to perform computations on the encrypted input and return the encrypted output. The user can then decrypt the output using the same Secret Key. While searching for such a solution, I came across Homomorphic Encryption.</p> <h1 id="homomorphic-encryption">Homomorphic Encryption</h1> <p>It is a cryptographic method to perform computations that are encrypted and produce the same product had the operations been performed on an unencrypted data. Almost all the operations can be performed in this space but with a certain amount of latency. The latency is due to the fact that the encrypted data is represented as a polynomial and the operations are performed on the polynomial. I came across a variety of papers and talks that focused on building models whose computations were performed in the encrypted space. The models were built from scratch and the computations were performed using the CKKS scheme. But can HME based methods be applied to existing LLM models like OpenAI GPT-3.5?</p> <h2 id="applying-to-openai-models---flant5">Applying to OpenAI models - FlanT5</h2> <p>I tried to arrive at a solution wherein you split the input embedding suitably into multiple embeddings (not encrypted) (in a reversible way). Then, pass the embeddings individually receiving output embedding for each input embedding and then constructing the final output embedding. Splitting the embeddings into even two parts has been proven to make it difficult for an adversary to figure out the original embedding. What are the computations done by FlanT5 model ?</p> <h1 id="applying-it-to-resnet-20-a-case-study">Applying it to ResNet-20: A case study</h1> <p>https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.07229.pdf</p> <h1 id="mpc-based-solution">MPC based solution</h1> <p>Multi Party Computation is another technique like HME to introduce privacy https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.01452.pdf</p> <h2 id="interesting-links">Interesting Links</h2> <p>Sentiment Analysis on Encrypoted Data: https://huggingface.co/blog/sentiment-analysis-fhe</p> <p>How Crypto is predicted to define ML: https://youtu.be/culuNbMPP0k</p> <p>CKKS Encryotion Scheme: https://blog.openmined.org/ckks-explained-part-5-rescaling/</p> <p>ZAMA AI’s ML models using HME: https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete-ml/tree/release/1.0.x https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lhn2GdHhGc&amp;ab_channel=GoogleTechTalks</p> <p>Privacy-Preserving Recommender Systems: https://huggingface.co/papers/2305.05973</p> <p>Privacy-Preserving Text Classification: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.02574.pdf</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction Presently, the user prompt input to models such as ChatGPT and Bard are not encrypted.
