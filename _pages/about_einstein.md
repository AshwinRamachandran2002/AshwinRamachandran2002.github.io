Hi there! I am Ashwin Ramachandran. I am a senior undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay in the Computer Science and Engineering department. Almost everything in computer science, with a specific liking for reinforcement learning and deep learning.

I am currently working on my Bacheor’s thesis on efficient graph retrival techniques advised by Prof. Soumen Chakrabarti and Prof. Abir De. I am also involved with Prof. Peter Stone’s research group at UT Austin, working on adverserial model learning paradigms. Moreover, for the past year, I have been working on a research project formulating new cryptographic definitions and primitives under the guidance of Prof. Manoj Prabhakaran.

During the summer of 2022, I interned at Optiver in Amsterdam as a software engineering intern with the Research & Data team. In the past, I have interned at Octro Inc. on a project involving creation on a Poker agent. I have also worked with Prof. Sándor P. Fekete’s group at Technische Universität Braunschweig on unsolved problems in graph theory.

When I’m not busy with academics or work, I like to read, strum my guitar or play a sport (preferably soccer or table tennis). As a hobby, I love working on web development projects and was a Project Lead at DevCom, the Developer’s Community of IIT Bombay, last year.

Always on the lookout for new opportunities in CS!

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
