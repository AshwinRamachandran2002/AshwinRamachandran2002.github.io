Hi there! I am Ashwin Ramachandran. I am a senior undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay in the [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/) department. Almost everything in computer science, with a specific liking for NLP and LLMs.

I am currently working on my *Bacheor's thesis* on Retrieval Augmented Generation advised by [Prof. Soumen Chakrabarti](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~soumen/) and [Prof. Sunita Sarawagi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~sunita/).

During the summer of 2022, I interned at Google in Bangalore as a software engineering intern. I have also worked with [Prof. Thomas Deserno](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=sdsxvdwAAAAJ) at [Technische Universit√§t Braunschweig](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/).

As a hobby, I love working on web development projects and was a Project Lead at [DevCom](https://in.linkedin.com/company/devcom-iit-bombay), the Developer's Community of IIT Bombay.

Always on the lookout for new opportunities in CS!
